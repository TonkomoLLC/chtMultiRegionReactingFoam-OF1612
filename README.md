# chtMultiRegionReactingFoam
OpenFOAM transient solver for buoyant, turbulent fluid flow and solid heat conduction with conjugate heat transfer between solid and fluid regions, plus combustion with chemical reactions.

# Notes
1. The OpenFOAM-v1706 branch also compiles with OpenFOAM-v1712
2. Release includes transient and steady state solvers (chtMultiRegionReactingFoam and chtMultiRegionSimpleReactingFoam).
3. Unsteady state solver benchmarked against DETCHEM, FLUENT and reactingFoam.
